This years rant will consist of two items. First lets discuss the eternal issue of lack of pay. We all know that working for a University results in a paycheck 15 to 20% less than typical outside jobs of the same type but right now I know of people that are 20 to 30% under the going rate while we sit and watch upper echelon employees get anywhere from $2000 to over $50,000 dollars pay raises since 2008. We are still trying to figure out how some people can get $251,249.96 in “Extra Pay”. It is understood that keeping quality people is important and pay is a very big incentive to keep these people but the message it sends is that we have plenty of money for people that already earn plenty of money but we cant cough up a quarter more an hour for the custodians or the grounds people let alone actually pay anyone else near what they are worth. It has been shown time and time again that to achieve higher wages your best bet is to get another job and be prepared to leave, then (and only then) the purse strings open. This sends the message that there is no reason for loyalty to the University just be a mercenary and you will get the pay increase, meanwhile the employee that is dedicated and long term receives nothing for that dedication and loyalty. I want to see what the reason for no pay raises this year will be. In the last several years it has been “The State keeps cutting our budget” … yes the state that only is about 10% of the UC budget effects every pay scale except when someone threatens to leave. Now that Prop 30 has passed, which I believe had a lot of help due to the veiled threat of “Vote for this or you will lose your job”, what will be the new invented reason for cutbacks. Hers one you can use … “Well, actually you guys are not really State employees you are Reagent employees and we cant afford to give you raises … unless you are already earning over $100,00 a year, then we got plenty of money. BTW it is interesting that the Treasurer of the Regents has earned an average of over $280,000 in “Extra Pay” over the last 5 years on top of her $470,000 base salary.</td>\n",

Yet this supervisor will demand that their subordinates respect them - respect is earned, it should not be taken for granted.A supervisor should not become a supervisor, just because they have been in the department for xx number of years.  Currently, there is a supervisor who does not have much knowledge about their area, they stay afloat only because of the dedicated and knowledgeable staff that work under them; however, that supervisor does not see it that way and takes everything for granted and tries to intimidate the staff by threatening them.  Intimidation and threats by a supervisor should not be a means to try to motivate staff - intimidation and threats will have a negative impact on staff.

This years rant will consist of two items. First lets discuss the eternal issue of lack of pay. We all know that working for a University results in a paycheck 15 to 20% less than typical outside jobs of the same type but right now I know of people that are 20 to 30% under the going rate while we sit and watch upper echelon employees get anywhere from $2000 to over $50,000 dollars pay raises since 2008. We are still trying to figure out how some people can get $251,249.96 in “Extra Pay”. It is understood that keeping quality people is important and pay is a very big incentive to keep these people but the message it sends is that we have plenty of money for people that already earn plenty of money but we cant cough up a quarter more an hour for the custodians or the grounds people let alone actually pay anyone else near what they are worth. It has been shown time and time again that to achieve higher wages your best bet is to get another job and be prepared to leave, then (and only then) the purse strings open. This sends the message that there is no reason for loyalty to the University just be a mercenary and you will get the pay increase, meanwhile the employee that is dedicated and long term receives nothing for that dedication and loyalty. I want to see what the reason for no pay raises this year will be.

       "      <td>Supervisor Effectiveness/Resolves Staff Issues: In the Enterprise Network and Telecommunications group of ITS, the environment continues to be toxic, retaliatory, abusive, and discriminatory as in past years. Under the direction of James Seddon, supervisor Malerie Samadi harasses and talks down to employees. Manipulates and edits official documentation to make staff look and give lower performance appraisal ratings or retaliate against them. Also, use the same practice to provide their friends with higher performance ratings and award them with higher merit increases.  Senior management continues to harbor this behavior without any consequence and or accountability. James and Malerie exploit minorities and give preferential treatment to personnel hired by them. Regularly abuse the power that the University of California gives them and exercise nepotism because they are both product of such practices.\\r\\nOther supervisors like Ynez Hicks also participates in the same practices of despotism, nepotism, and favoritism. \\r\\nIt is unacceptable that this behavior and practices continue to be used by management without any accountability.  Principles of the community are ignored continuously daily. When this type of situation is brought up to Human Resources, they ignore them because no one is enforcing the UC Principles. James Seddon and Malerie Samadi in the Datacom group don't care about staff promotion, compensation, and well being. They only care about themselves and their friends. Hiring practices are unfair; they manipulate the process so they can hire barely qualified personnel into experienced positions. Existing staff is overworked because newer personnel can not pull their weight, yet Malerie and James make it look like they are in their appraisals. They mentally abuse staff and minimize their work performance. Recently one of the team member past away while working at home. A stroke caused by the stress and the pressure that Malerie was putting on David Ramirez. She used him to get her promotion to supervisor and make her look good in front of others.\\r\\nBoth James and Malerie are the perfect examples of bad management. Somehow they continue to occupy their positions, and Senior Management doesn't do anything about it.  \\r\\nThe lowest level the Datacom team has been in years, all because of James and Malerie's arrogance and lack of ethics.</td>\n",

I do not feel the same since ESR. RSC has limited job functionality because OFC was rolled-out without appropriate reporting and or cost transfers. We have spent many frustrating hours trying to figure out how to access the systems and functions that are up and running (Path). We are left on the front lines with faculty and departments with inadequate tools to help.\\r\\nThe issues above do not make me feel valued as a member of the UC San Diego community or like leadership listens. It feels like no one even stopped to think about what a fund manager does, and how they will be able to continue those functions in the new systems. \\r\\nI realize now it is hard for me to comment on inclusion. I think we do a good job, or at least try to, but I am not in a group that would have ever felt excluded based on my background or orientation.  \\r\\nAmount of work remains an issue. The job expands to the hours allotted. We could do a lot better, more thorough and thoughtful work if we had some space to breath and think. Instead we are running from one fire to the next. Many areas had to learn 1 new ESR system. We had to learn ALL of them. It's WAY too much. On top of already having more than enough work to fill every minute of a 40 hr week. And we have learned that somewhere in the ESR process, it was decided (without our knowledge/input/concurrence) that we would take on more duties.  Yay.</td>\n",

       "      <td>theme: Supervisor Effectiveness/Resolves Staff Issues comment: In the Enterprise Network and Telecommunications group of ITS, the environment continues to be toxic, retaliatory, abusive, and discriminatory as in past years. Under the direction of James Seddon, supervisor Malerie Samadi harasses and talks down to employees. Manipulates and edits official documentation to make staff look and give lower performance appraisal ratings or retaliate against them. Also, use the same practice to provide their friends with higher performance ratings and award them with higher merit increases.  Senior management continues to harbor this behavior without any consequence and or accountability. James and Malerie exploit minorities and give preferential treatment to personnel hired by them. Regularly abuse the power that the University of California gives them and exercise nepotism because they are both product of such practices.\\r\\nOther supervisors like Ynez Hicks also participates in the same practices of despotism, nepotism, and favoritism. \\r\\nIt is unacceptable that this behavior and practices continue to be used by management without any accountability.  Principles of the community are ignored continuously daily. When this type of situation is brought up to Human Resources, they ignore them because no one is enforcing the UC Principles. James Seddon and Malerie Samadi in the Datacom group don't care about staff promotion, compensation, and well being. They only care about themselves and their friends. Hiring practices are unfair; they manipulate the process so they can hire barely qualified personnel into experienced positions. Existing staff is overworked because newer personnel can not pull their weight, yet Malerie and James make it look like they are in their appraisals. They mentally abuse staff and minimize their work performance. Recently one of the team member past away while working at home. A stroke caused by the stress and the pressure that Malerie was putting on David Ramirez. She used him to get her promotion to supervisor and make her look good in front of others.\\r\\nBoth James and Malerie are the perfect examples of bad management. Somehow they continue to occupy their positions, and Senior Management doesn't do anything about it.  \\r\\nThe lowest level the Datacom team has been in years, all because of James and Malerie's arrogance and lack of ethics.</td>\n",

       "      <td>theme: Have Voice within my Institution/Valued Member of my Institution comment: It is tough to answer the questions this year. \\r\\nI used to know my resources, and feel positively about training. I do not feel the same since ESR. RSC has limited job functionality because OFC was rolled-out without appropriate reporting and or cost transfers. We have spent many frustrating hours trying to figure out how to access the systems and functions that are up and running (Path). We are left on the front lines with faculty and departments with inadequate tools to help.\\r\\nThe issues above do not make me feel valued as a member of the UC San Diego community or like leadership listens. It feels like no one even stopped to think about what a fund manager does, and how they will be able to continue those functions in the new systems. \\r\\nI realize now it is hard for me to comment on inclusion. I think we do a good job, or at least try to, but I am not in a group that would have ever felt excluded based on my background or orientation.  \\r\\nAmount of work remains an issue. The job expands to the hours allotted. We could do a lot better, more thorough and thoughtful work if we had some space to breath and think. Instead we are running from one fire to the next. Many areas had to learn 1 new ESR system. We had to learn ALL of them. It's WAY too much. On top of already having more than enough work to fill every minute of a 40 hr week. And we have learned that somewhere in the ESR process, it was decided (without our knowledge/input/concurrence) that we would take on more duties.  Yay.</td>\n",
