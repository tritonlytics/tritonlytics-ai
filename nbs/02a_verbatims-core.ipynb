Many are soft skill-deficient, and in misguided attempts to entrench themselves in the confines of their immediate staff for protection, they lose respect and the ability to work with others.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, hard skills are easy to pick up.

       "      <td>Supervisor Effectiveness/Resolves Staff Issues: In the Enterprise Network and Telecommunications group of ITS, the environment continues to be toxic, retaliatory, abusive, and discriminatory as in past years. Under the direction of James Seddon, supervisor Malerie Samadi harasses and talks down to employees. Manipulates and edits official documentation to make staff look and give lower performance appraisal ratings or retaliate against them. Also, use the same practice to provide their friends with higher performance ratings and award them with higher merit increases.  Senior management continues to harbor this behavior without any consequence and or accountability. James and Malerie exploit minorities and give preferential treatment to personnel hired by them. Regularly abuse the power that the University of California gives them and exercise nepotism because they are both product of such practices.\\r\\nOther supervisors like Ynez Hicks also participates in the same practices of despotism, nepotism, and favoritism. \\r\\nIt is unacceptable that this behavior and practices continue to be used by management without any accountability.  Principles of the community are ignored continuously daily. When this type of situation is brought up to Human Resources, they ignore them because no one is enforcing the UC Principles. James Seddon and Malerie Samadi in the Datacom group don't care about staff promotion, compensation, and well being. They only care about themselves and their friends. Hiring practices are unfair; they manipulate the process so they can hire barely qualified personnel into experienced positions. Existing staff is overworked because newer personnel can not pull their weight, yet Malerie and James make it look like they are in their appraisals. They mentally abuse staff and minimize their work performance. Recently one of the team member past away while working at home. A stroke caused by the stress and the pressure that Malerie was putting on David Ramirez. She used him to get her promotion to supervisor and make her look good in front of others.\\r\\nBoth James and Malerie are the perfect examples of bad management. Somehow they continue to occupy their positions, and Senior Management doesn't do anything about it.  \\r\\nThe lowest level the Datacom team has been in years, all because of James and Malerie's arrogance and lack of ethics.</td>\n",

       "      <td>theme: Supervisor Effectiveness/Resolves Staff Issues comment: In the Enterprise Network and Telecommunications group of ITS, the environment continues to be toxic, retaliatory, abusive, and discriminatory as in past years. Under the direction of James Seddon, supervisor Malerie Samadi harasses and talks down to employees. Manipulates and edits official documentation to make staff look and give lower performance appraisal ratings or retaliate against them. Also, use the same practice to provide their friends with higher performance ratings and award them with higher merit increases.  Senior management continues to harbor this behavior without any consequence and or accountability. James and Malerie exploit minorities and give preferential treatment to personnel hired by them. Regularly abuse the power that the University of California gives them and exercise nepotism because they are both product of such practices.\\r\\nOther supervisors like Ynez Hicks also participates in the same practices of despotism, nepotism, and favoritism. \\r\\nIt is unacceptable that this behavior and practices continue to be used by management without any accountability.  Principles of the community are ignored continuously daily. When this type of situation is brought up to Human Resources, they ignore them because no one is enforcing the UC Principles. James Seddon and Malerie Samadi in the Datacom group don't care about staff promotion, compensation, and well being. They only care about themselves and their friends. Hiring practices are unfair; they manipulate the process so they can hire barely qualified personnel into experienced positions. Existing staff is overworked because newer personnel can not pull their weight, yet Malerie and James make it look like they are in their appraisals. They mentally abuse staff and minimize their work performance. Recently one of the team member past away while working at home. A stroke caused by the stress and the pressure that Malerie was putting on David Ramirez. She used him to get her promotion to supervisor and make her look good in front of others.\\r\\nBoth James and Malerie are the perfect examples of bad management. Somehow they continue to occupy their positions, and Senior Management doesn't do anything about it.  \\r\\nThe lowest level the Datacom team has been in years, all because of James and Malerie's arrogance and lack of ethics.</td>\n",

       "      <td>theme: Advancement and Training Opportunities comment: 1.\\tSensitivity and bias training for SLBO management – The selection and search for the person to fill Evelyns position seemed inequitable.  Evelyn having a say in her successor may not have been against campus hiring policies but did not seem appropriate since she had inside knowledge of some of the candidates and a possible bias for or against other candidates.  \\r\\n  I applied for the position because my applying was suggested by another member of Evelyns team that was not on the committee.\\r\\nAnna, a member of the committee, was also under the leadership of Evelyn.  Anna, who now has been promoted into Jamies positions would not be in Jamies position if he had not gotten Evelyns position.  In addition, there was no one in the room from HR ensuring that the interviews were fair and equal.  I think that this Cluster is large enough to warrant additional oversite with the filling of positions. \\r\\nThough it may not matter to some but within the SLBO all of senior management (HR remains neutral) is now male while 99 %  of the rest of the staff is female.  \\r\\n2.\\tWhen work is removed from my desk work of equal or greater substance should replace it (the work removed).\\r\\n3.\\tTo remove budgetary work from me and replace it with transactional work is belittling along with a misuse of my high level skill set, experience, and education.  I am often the person who trains or provides information to new staff on our tools within Financial Link.  \\r\\n4.\\tI want to see equality in secession training for management positions within the SLBO or other departments in the cluster.</td>\n",
