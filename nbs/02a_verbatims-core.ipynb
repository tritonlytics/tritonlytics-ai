This years rant will consist of two items. First lets discuss the eternal issue of lack of pay. We all know that working for a University results in a paycheck 15 to 20% less than typical outside jobs of the same type but right now I know of people that are 20 to 30% under the going rate while we sit and watch upper echelon employees get anywhere from $2000 to over $50,000 dollars pay raises since 2008. We are still trying to figure out how some people can get $251,249.96 in “Extra Pay”. It is understood that keeping quality people is important and pay is a very big incentive to keep these people but the message it sends is that we have plenty of money for people that already earn plenty of money but we cant cough up a quarter more an hour for the custodians or the grounds people let alone actually pay anyone else near what they are worth. It has been shown time and time again that to achieve higher wages your best bet is to get another job and be prepared to leave, then (and only then) the purse strings open. This sends the message that there is no reason for loyalty to the University just be a mercenary and you will get the pay increase, meanwhile the employee that is dedicated and long term receives nothing for that dedication and loyalty. I want to see what the reason for no pay raises this year will be. In the last several years it has been “The State keeps cutting our budget” … yes the state that only is about 10% of the UC budget effects every pay scale except when someone threatens to leave. Now that Prop 30 has passed, which I believe had a lot of help due to the veiled threat of “Vote for this or you will lose your job”, what will be the new invented reason for cutbacks. Hers one you can use … “Well, actually you guys are not really State employees you are Reagent employees and we cant afford to give you raises … unless you are already earning over $100,00 a year, then we got plenty of money. BTW it is interesting that the Treasurer of the Regents has earned an average of over $280,000 in “Extra Pay” over the last 5 years on top of her $470,000 base salary.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I feel UCSD favors minorities PERIOD - I have seen a lot of reverse discrimination.  We have a joke that whenever a minority is hired we call it  \"diversity strikes again\".  It is blatant when we have first hand knowledge that a positionis filled with a minority person only because they are a minority, with absolutely NO relation to their skill level. All qtns asked to confirm a hire are based on whether there was a minority in the interview pool.  How about if they are qualified???  Then the diversity awards actually awards people for hiring minorities....who cares if they can't do the job?  (Yeah, we win, we've hired 2 minorities.) I also feel people take complete advantage of stress/disability leave when it is their personal lives that are stressed out, NOT their work life. They just do not want to do their job. It truly affects all of us who have to pick up the pieces. If they can't handle the job, get another one, don't make everyone else stress out, just because the have some quack doctor signing a piece of paper.  UCSD is great for people who know how to work the system.  Having these people take advantage of it causes major morale problems. I feel that the lowly people like myself deserve raises. Money is always miraculously found when its needed.  Some people are paid just because they threaten to sue if someone looks at them wrong, and then there are the ones, like myself, who actually want to earn a decent living and work hard to do it.  I am flabberghasted when I see certain people doing nothing and getting paid the BIG bucks. I often wonder if HR is for the employee or on the side of the University. I don't feel like we are supported by the HR department. They seem more intent on screwing whomever they can, than doing what's best for the employee.  I don't feel they can be trusted.  I also don't understand why we have a separate HR department.  What for???  Support staff do not make enough to live on.  It is so frustrating.  Don't think I'm a disgruntled employee, I thoroughly like my boss, like the work I do, and like being associated with the University. There are just a lot of work inequities because UCSD is so afraid of being sued and also the pay inequities between like positions.  Some places give 25% pay increases, others say they can only give</td>\n",

This years rant will consist of two items. First lets discuss the eternal issue of lack of pay. We all know that working for a University results in a paycheck 15 to 20% less than typical outside jobs of the same type but right now I know of people that are 20 to 30% under the going rate while we sit and watch upper echelon employees get anywhere from $2000 to over $50,000 dollars pay raises since 2008. We are still trying to figure out how some people can get $251,249.96 in “Extra Pay”. It is understood that keeping quality people is important and pay is a very big incentive to keep these people but the message it sends is that we have plenty of money for people that already earn plenty of money but we cant cough up a quarter more an hour for the custodians or the grounds people let alone actually pay anyone else near what they are worth. It has been shown time and time again that to achieve higher wages your best bet is to get another job and be prepared to leave, then (and only then) the purse strings open. This sends the message that there is no reason for loyalty to the University just be a mercenary and you will get the pay increase, meanwhile the employee that is dedicated and long term receives nothing for that dedication and loyalty. I want to see what the reason for no pay raises this year will be. In the last several years it has been “The State keeps cutting our budget” … yes the state that only is about 10% of the UC budget effects every pay scale except when someone threatens to leave. Now that Prop 30 has passed, which I believe had a lot of help due to the veiled threat of “Vote for this or you will lose your job”, what will be the new invented reason for cutbacks.

Although university leadership does its best for everyone, sometimes when one group is supported it appears that another group is not. I've had Latino and Jewish students in my office sharing their fear of fellow students who hated them because of their ethnic or religious background.  I remember one Caucasian student who after taking a History course and learning about American injustices against Latinos was too embarrassed to admit he was White.  I had to remind him of the good things Americans have done.  I've seen several students be ashamed of their Arts and Humanities major because so much attention is being given to STEM majors by the university and media.  STEM students sometimes have made fun of A&amp;H or Social Science students because they somehow think they are smarter or will be making more money after graduation. Students should not be feeling scared or inferior to any other student regardless of ethnic, political or religious background, or because they chose to major in Classical Studies.  We need to do more for any group or individual that feels threatened or inferior in any way- do more in our teaching, advertising, campus articles, events, counseling, advising- in all services the university provides.  The sense of superiority and arrogance sometimes found in a few faculty, staff and students should be set straight and not overlooked. Our all of students can win at life.</td>\n",

San Diego MTS is not optimized to transport people to UCSD's campus so there are obviously many holes.

The old school mentality of supervisors in my department makes it so my colleagues and I have to suffer through the awful commute to/from campus and pay for parking 5 days a week.

There was little explanation for the change and  the whole thing was very badly handled by the University. The gas cards don't work half the time and we have had to come out of pocket for gasoline in addition to what we've already paid (after tax) without reimbursement or credit from Enterprise to date. This is NOT acceptable. \\r\\nIn addition Sorrento Valley Coaster Shuttle service has been shut down by the University for the North County commuters. This University talks about lowering our carbon footprint but removes the very programs designed to do so. It's disgusting!!! \\r\\nMore people have been put on the roads to campus while parking is quickly disappearing for those who work so hard to make UCSD a world-class university. There seems to be no plan in place for fixing the mess that has been made. If there is a plan it is being poorly communicated. These changes should have been made AFTER the trolley service was up and running, but now people are scrambling on their own to fix a problem that was manufactured by Commute Solutions. Everything about how these programs were handled is WRONG!!!\\r\\nThe only good thing is that we are still able to get 10 days per quarter for parking if needed and there is the free ride home program for emergencies.

During that second visit, most of the staff (young people) were not proactive or really wanted to work. Some of them were speaking in a bad way to each other (either joking or not) and were rude to the young lady that was helping me. That caused a very bad impression to me because it seems even the supervisor was not helpful. The good thing of this second visit was that the lady allowed to get one moth of the eco pass. My last visit was to try to change the dates of my eco pass trial and all the staff was terrible at this, they did not know how to help so they gave me a phone number to call, when I called the same person that was helping me replied and said that he picked up the phone but that was not his phone so that I should try again, I tried and of course no one replied this time. I finally get the name of the person in charge that coincidentally left early that day and left no one in charge to help me with my problem. I get desperate and decided not to insist on this issue.

       "      <td>Supervisor Effectiveness/Resolves Staff Issues: In the Enterprise Network and Telecommunications group of ITS, the environment continues to be toxic, retaliatory, abusive, and discriminatory as in past years. Under the direction of James Seddon, supervisor Malerie Samadi harasses and talks down to employees. Manipulates and edits official documentation to make staff look and give lower performance appraisal ratings or retaliate against them. Also, use the same practice to provide their friends with higher performance ratings and award them with higher merit increases.  Senior management continues to harbor this behavior without any consequence and or accountability. James and Malerie exploit minorities and give preferential treatment to personnel hired by them. Regularly abuse the power that the University of California gives them and exercise nepotism because they are both product of such practices.\\r\\nOther supervisors like Ynez Hicks also participates in the same practices of despotism, nepotism, and favoritism. \\r\\nIt is unacceptable that this behavior and practices continue to be used by management without any accountability.  Principles of the community are ignored continuously daily. When this type of situation is brought up to Human Resources, they ignore them because no one is enforcing the UC Principles. James Seddon and Malerie Samadi in the Datacom group don't care about staff promotion, compensation, and well being. They only care about themselves and their friends. Hiring practices are unfair; they manipulate the process so they can hire barely qualified personnel into experienced positions. Existing staff is overworked because newer personnel can not pull their weight, yet Malerie and James make it look like they are in their appraisals. They mentally abuse staff and minimize their work performance. Recently one of the team member past away while working at home. A stroke caused by the stress and the pressure that Malerie was putting on David Ramirez. She used him to get her promotion to supervisor and make her look good in front of others.\\r\\nBoth James and Malerie are the perfect examples of bad management.

       "      <td>theme: Supervisor Effectiveness/Resolves Staff Issues comment: The change from Aline to Dave Kimber has been a meaningful improvement for our department. Aline was pervasively corrosive, but Dave approaches employees with respect and is working toward resolving many of the problems she introduced; a change for which I'm grateful. Working for Dr. Sirlin is a truly exceptional experience. He actively and consistently works to improve diversity and inclusion within our lab, treats employees well, fosters our career growth, and is the best example I have worked with of a male leader in a position of power who treats female colleagues and employees as equals. Dr. Norbash is also an exemplar of inclusion and respect and sets a resoundingly positive and progressive tone for our department. It is a pleasure to work under the leadership of Drs. Sirlin and Norbash and I consistently learn from them. I would like to see improvement in the procedures for employee promotion and growth. The current structures make it difficult to promote my employees who have earned promotion. E.g., an employee shouldn't have to go through open recruitment and wait eight months for the job card they are already performing. If campus would like to better engage HS employees in the their mission, one idea would be providing educational resources that are more affordable, such as undergraduate courses for staff development, or really any affordable educational resources. I liked Dr. Chung's message asking for our prospective faith and positivity; Dr. Chung, I'm in.</td>\n",
