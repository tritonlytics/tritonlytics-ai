      "W46 - I have expressed concerns abt the changes being made - specifically that W46, as I understand, is now a lot that can be assigned as an overflow lot. Given the restricted number of spaces available now, this seems an undue burden on those of us who park in it as a primary lot, particularly given my second point: W45 is no longer available as an overflow lot for W46. We are told that we can use lots very far away as overflow lots, when there is a whole 2nd garage available right next to the first one. First, this is a waste of my valuable work time - why should I have to walk from a far overflow location, when a second garage is available right here? I pay a lot of money to park close to where I work. And no, this is not a choice. I have a family situation that requires, for now, that I have a car available at a moment's notice. I can't park far away, in another lot several blocks away. My point is that I don't feel that the parking office is listening. They are doing what the grand plan says they should do, with no concern for feedback from those of us who are impacted.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is asinine that I spent more than $8000/quarter in a health sciences graduate program and do not have guaranteed parking near the buildings that I need (T-wing and SOCC).  S1 is often \"full\" even when parking spots are obviously available.  Just today I had to park at the stadium and walk to the far end of the health sciences building with 4+ bags (I am a milk-pumping/breastfeeding new mom) after spending $27 to park because I have to be here all day.  I spend $80/quarter for a U-pass I cant use due to transportation needs for my child.  I spend money each quarter for a gym membership I can't use because my childcare schedule doesn't allow it.  So I am forced to spend money for services I can't use and forced again to spend extra money for the inconvenience of parking far away with tons of bags.  All this on top of a ridiculous amount of tuition.  The way the University forces me to pay for services I don't need and doesn't help (in fact, makes it worse) to use services I actually DO need is infuriating.  I definitely do not tell people I know who are interested in a similar degree that it is worth it to obtain it at the UW.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that UW offers free bus transportation. However, the commuter lounge is a competitive place where you have to get there early to get a locker and it's always crowded. There is no place for a commuter to take a secluded break! \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I chose to drive because otherwise I would have to take two buses and have no area to relax between classes like students who can go to their dorms. It's also just not practical as an engineering student to spend three hours of precious time per day on the bus. Now I have to pay a ridiculous fee to park here - I'm a student, not a professional paying for parking in the city. I understand that it's essentially a carbon tax, but if you don't want me to drive, can you please talk to commuter services about improving and expanding their facilities?\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, after I have paid the ridiculous fee to park in E18, please associate my license plate with the parking pass and don't give me a ticket if I forget to put my pass in the window. It's 2019 and I've paid all this money-- can you give the parking attendants a list of E18 license plates please? It's a huge headache to have to appeal the ticket that I paid to avoid in the first place.\n",

      "I work in henderson hall W10. It's probably not parkings fault, but our lot has been sold off \"temporarily\" (for years now) to construction workers. It used to be somewhat used by workers, but now it's mostly empty every single day now. I used to have ICT's for the lot as I drive about once a month because I need to bring in heavy things that I can't take on my bike. My only options now are the PPU program to a garage that is almost as far away as parking in the neighborhood off campus and walking in. Why is our lot still reserved for people that don't use it? I want the ICT's back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would be REALLY NICE to have a clear, easily accessible posting online of when weekend parking on campus ISN'T free because of special events. If it is there, I haven't been able to find it. Grad students who drive in to work on the weekend only to find that \"this Sunday, you can't park here\" is frustrating.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso cheap/free load/unload parking passes for people doing outreach activities. E.g. we do a lot of science nights at local elementary schools, and need to load a bunch of equipment into whatever student volunteered that day's car in the building's loading dock. The parking people have come and told us off and threatened to ticket us for not buying a parking pass, when all we need is 5 minutes to load the science equipment into the car to go do public outreach on behalf of the university that apparently wants to ticket us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I work part time.  I wanted to park close to work and pay only 3 days/week.  They said the only way they could do that is for me to have to walk all the way over to parking office every 3 months, which is a huge burden.  I'm a physician, I seldom get a full lunch break and I work over a mile away.  They refused to mail it to me. They also said I had to park pretty far away and walk (about 10-15 minutes) because they didn't have room in the closer lot.  They said they' put me on a wait list for the Padelford Lot but I have never heard back and that was about a year ago.  I have to pay $15 at the card machine to park in Padelford visitor spaces.\n",

      "I requested a monthly parking pass at a parking garage near Harborview, but was told that no parking passes are available at View Park or NJB.  I was told that I could either buy a monthly pass at a garage multiple blocks from Harborview, or pay a daily rate for parking at View Park or NJB. (The latter option is much more expensive than a monthly pass.) Parking at a garage multiple blocks away is not a safe option for me, as I frequently work shifts that end at night when it is not safe to walk alone. I requested that Parking Services staff explore ways to increase availability of monthly parking passes in View Park and NJB, but was brusquely told that this would not be an option under any circumstances. I am dissatisfied with the lack of willingness to have transparent discussions or problem-solve about issues that directly affect staff well-being.\n",

For 6 years, I walked from main campus to that parking lot. This year, I switched to central plaza and luckily there was a space. I could not bear to walk feeling unsafe anymore. Homeless and drug users line the walk from main campus to the W45 and they blow smoke in your face, holler at you, and say inappropriate things. They have bonfires and exchange drugs. I was walking with my child one day when a homeless person popped out and stuck a hypodermic needle right in his own arm - my child was freaked out. I constantly felt unsafe. Please work with UWPD to fix that area. I would never send my child to UW if I saw Univ Ave and this walk. I'm an incredibly tolerant person but it's just gone too far.\n",

      "As a late-stage graduate student (basically just a working scientist at this point), I often need to come into my lab for brief periods even when I'm otherwise working from home or taking the day off. Yet the parking options near Roberts Hall are abysmal, and the gatehouse workers usually decline to give me an hourly permit for Lot C12 near the building, even after I explain that I'm a graduate student who works near there. This means I usually have to park far away from my building and walk (often in the rain, sometimes carrying large items!) across campus. And I shouldn't have to tell you that buying a quarterly parking pass is out of the question on a graduate student budget. \\r\\n\\r\\nLook, I understand that you don't want students crowding out staff/faculty who have permits for these lots with limited space, but I AM ALSO WORKING FOR THE UNIVERSITY.

      "Parking on campus is ridiculously expensive for students. Paying over $1000 dollars an academic year to park on campus is excessive, unmanageable, and unrealistic for many students, both those who live in the dorms and those who commute. I understand that space is limited, however, I know that not all the parking permits available on campus are used. Having access to a car for students at the UW should not be an extra burden and stressor, but a convenience meant to make student's already stressful lives easier. Many students hold off-campus jobs or commute from far distances. Having to pay an excessive amount to park either at their place of residence or their educational institution is extremely difficult for students and unethical from the university. Parking for students should be a reasonable expense, especially given how much they already have to pay to receive an education. $350 a quarter to park on campus is too expensive.\n",

      "I find it fully insane that the state's premier institution of higher learning doesn't have a staff and faculty parking lot.  I appreciate that space is at a premium, but I have found that the parking situation to be frustrating, confusing, and inefficient.  I was on a waiting list for weeks before being admitted to the first parking lot in which I was authorized.  The staff at Parking Services said that the pay-per-use rate was $6.00 per use.  After using the lot for some time, I found on my deductions email that the *actual* rate was $7.50 per use.  While I appreciate that these are nominal differences, it's still frustrating to be paying more than was advertised.  Additionally, after months of waiting, I was admitted to a lot nearer my work-site in the School of Social Work.  I have never seen that lot any more than 40% full at any time of day.  The idea that there are wait lists for facilities that are not in full use is frustrating.  While I understand that not everyone who is signed up may park in the same place at the same time, the aggregate experience of paying more than the promised rate, spending weeks-to-months on waiting lists, and not being able to park anywhere other than the designated lot (which is never even close to full) leaves a bad, frustrating taste in one's mouth.  I've worked as a contractor in a variety of places and have always been able to access staff parking.  It's surprising and disappointing that this is not a standard practice at the UW.\n",

      "Because campus outsources this to various companies, it's hit or miss with the staff I come into contact with. I've received tickets despite having a permit, and have contacted them, received no response, but never had repercussions about my ticket fee--so I've had to assume the case was dropped.\\r\\nThe prices for parking at a campus like UW Tacoma are exorbitant. Public transport is not extensive/far reaching, reliable, or safe enough for people like me who live extremely far away from campus. We have no choice but to commute, and the prices of parking permits are ridiculous.\\r\\nAdditionally, the site crashes and becomes inaccessible every time permits go on sale because of the high demand. \\r\\nHaving evening permits for Court 17 makes no sense, either. The permits for the TPS Lot are so limited, and yet the lot is always empty. It makes no sense. \\r\\nThe parking meters at the Convention Center Lot E parking have been covered in spider webs, and completely nonfunctional more than once.\\r\\nThe Cragle Lot often rejects my card repeatedly before finally working.\\r\\nThe Tioga Lot frequently runs out of paper for receipts which prevents people from parking there, even when it's available.\\r\\nStreet parking being limited to 90 minutes is ludicrous--classes are 2 hours minimum, and for staff, we can't run across campus to repay for parking that often. It needs to be longer--and cheaper. We also need campus blue buttons closer to street parking for safety.\n",

      "The parking services staff are always helpful and courteous.  My biggest critique is that there is no way to purchase a Saturday morning parking pass in advance.  I regularly taking sailing classes and workshops through the UW's sailing club and we sometimes have to leave the dock before the 7am opening of the parking service booths.  Because of this, I am forced to purchase parking from the meter (in E19) which charges $3 an hour instead of being able to buy a parking pass.  This means that for a Saturday morning there is a difference between a $5 pass and $15 in metered parking.  It seems silly that there isn't a way to purchase a Saturday morning pass in advance, particularly as the reason I am parking there is for a UW related activity.  This seems like it could be an easy fix and is needlessly restrictive, but I have had no luck finding someone who has the authority to address this concern.\n",

The time it took to respond to the appeal was also long, about 3 weeks. Also, I am a commuting student and last quarter got a parking permit for over $300. I was told that since I was a commuting student the only place I could get a parking permit for was in lot E18. E18 is near the soccer field and was very far from my classes. I had to walk a long distance (in bad weather most of the time) to get to my classes, and eventually stopped parking there in the middle of fall quarter since it was too much for me to handle. I ended up parking in another lot that cost me a lot each day. There should be more parking options for commuting students which are closer to campus, such as the parking garage near Schmitz hall. I have tried parking at this lot however it is always full, and I cannot get a spot. This is very frustrating for me and other commuting students. I hope that new parking options open for commuting students next quarter.\n",

      "I am an employee of UW headquartered at Harborview. I pay a biweekly fee for motorcycle parking there. I visit  the UWMC campus up to twice weekly and ride a motorcycle. Though I pay a monthly rate for motorcycle parking, this isn't recognized at UWMC, and I am expected to pay the typical parking rate for motorcycle parking that the public pays, even though I am there as a UW employee, and I have already paid for parking at my place of employment.  A person can't be in 2 places at once, yet at UWMC, one is expected to pay for motorcycle parking in 2 places at the same time. Also, the parking fee for motorcycles is greater than that for cars, as there is no hourly motorcycle parking fee.  Most motorcycles get gas mileage in excess of most hybrid vehicles, take up less space in parking, and use less non-renewable resources in their operation and construction. It is unfortunate for UW Parking to disincentivize a more efficient and environmentally friendly method of transportation. So, I end up parking on the street on Boat Street because it is cheaper than UW parking.  I am aware that there is a shuttle from Harborview, but I am not traveling to UWMC from Harborview, I am coming from dialysis units in the Central District and Lake City that are not served by public transportation that would get me there and back in less than 1.5 hours so that is not a practical option either.

I spend $80/quarter for a U-pass I cant use due to transportation needs for my child.  I spend money each quarter for a gym membership I can't use because my childcare schedule doesn't allow it.  So I am forced to spend money for services I can't use and forced again to spend extra money for the inconvenience of parking far away with tons of bags.  All this on top of a ridiculous amount of tuition.  The way the University forces me to pay for services I don't need and doesn't help (in fact, makes it worse) to use services I actually DO need is infuriating.

      "Overall, I am very satisfied with parking services and the services and help that I received. In particular, customer service has been among the best I have ever received! One request that I would like to make is to allocate at least some spaces for STAFF parking in lot S1. Currently, we must go through our department to request spaces in this lot and my department has a rule where only faculty are allowed to park in this lot. I would urge that Parking Services take back the ability to assign spaces in this lot (for at least some spaces if it is not possible to do so for all) in cases where it is solely controlled by the department and reassign spaces in this lot in a more equitable manner, or at the very least use a lottery system so that everyone has an EQUAL opportunity to have access to this lot. In addition, many times, I have encountered situations where I needed to park for 20-60 minutes to \"run into\" the building and there was no short-term parking available near the Health Sciences complex. At the very least, it would be much appreciated if you could add a dozen or so spaces where staff may be able to park short term (<60 mins) when they need to access the building briefly.

      "There are many ways in which parking services could be improved, and I expect that changes would take time and significant cost. Nevertheless, it would be a great improvement if parking vouchers and issues could be managed online. An example of an issue that could be improved is that at Harborview, if you badge into one parking garage, but the lot is full (e.g., the nest in P2), you must badge into another garage/level and lose two of your paid vouchers. The only way to correct this is to go to the parking office, which can be quite time-consuming. If there were a way that the badge reader permitted a few minutes (e.g., within 10 minutes of badging in, you can leave without consequence), that would be a big time-saver. Additionally, there are parking garages where the entrance has a count of open spaces, and some that have green/red lights on every spot to indicate openings. While this would require more time and expense, I think this would be incredibly helpful. Finally, I want to say that I greatly appreciate the discounted rates of vouchers for physicians.\n",

A number of our passengers live there now and we are not allowed to access the upper, main, ADA entrances or designate any stop/s at those locations. It would be a reasonable accommodation to allow us this access as we meet the requirements of \"service vehicles,\" as posted at the entrance by Haggett Hall. As it exists now, we must watch as large trucks, private trucks, Uber, Lyft and a host of other vehicles drive past the sign at Haggett and up to the dorms. This \"restriction\" is not enforced, and as an ADA-related, Federally-mandated service, we belong closest to ADA entrances to these buildings.

Just today I had to park at the stadium and walk to the far end of the health sciences building with 4+ bags (I am a milk-pumping/breastfeeding new mom) after spending $27 to park because I have to be here all day.  I spend $80/quarter for a U-pass I cant use due to transportation needs for my child.  I spend money each quarter for a gym membership I can't use because my childcare schedule doesn't allow it.  So I am forced to spend money for services I can't use and forced again to spend extra money for the inconvenience of parking far away with tons of bags.  All this on top of a ridiculous amount of tuition.  The way the University forces me to pay for services I don't need and doesn't help (in fact, makes it worse) to use services I actually DO need is infuriating.  I definitely do not tell people I know who are interested in a similar degree that it is worth it to obtain it at the UW.\n",

      "Parking on campus is ridiculously expensive for students. Paying over $1000 dollars an academic year to park on campus is excessive, unmanageable, and unrealistic for many students, both those who live in the dorms and those who commute. I understand that space is limited, however, I know that not all the parking permits available on campus are used. Having access to a car for students at the UW should not be an extra burden and stressor, but a convenience meant to make student's already stressful lives easier. Many students hold off-campus jobs or commute from far distances. Having to pay an excessive amount to park either at their place of residence or their educational institution is extremely difficult for students and unethical from the university. Parking for students should be a reasonable expense, especially given how much they already have to pay to receive an education. $350 a quarter to park on campus is too expensive.\n",

Even basic management of their parking locations is problematic, for example each year faculty must renew their parking permits and faculty/staff receive their new permits in mid June, with new permits being required in July.   Yet because this is summer break it is easy to forget the new permit when the switch happens that first week in July.   Every single year I see dozens of people ticketed in the parking garage for having their old permits rather than the new.   Why parking services doesn't put up a sign at the entrance of their facilities like the central garage reminding everyone I honestly don't know.  My guess is that they want the added revenue from all the tickets and are more interested in that than treating their customers well.

Public transport is not extensive/far reaching, reliable, or safe enough for people like me who live extremely far away from campus. We have no choice but to commute, and the prices of parking permits are ridiculous.\\r\\nAdditionally, the site crashes and becomes inaccessible every time permits go on sale because of the high demand. \\r\\nHaving evening permits for Court 17 makes no sense, either.

I have been made to pay several dollars for half hour permits (which are too short) to load UW equipment into my car so that I can do UW sponsored research. Parking staff refuse to grant me free commercial load permits, saying that I am not delivering goods commercially. This is true, but shouldn't people conducting official UW business be allowed free loading passes if commercial deliveries who are visiting for profit are allowed free loading passes? Parking staff have agreed with my reasoning, but said they have to do things by the book, making no effort whatsoever to improve the situation. They have said that I could rent UCars which would be exempt from the permit requirements (which is not true), or simply claim parking costs, but all these would result in unnecessary financial burden on my tight research budget. I have tried loading my equipment after hours, but that has been made practically impossible by recent changes to make parking enforcement hours between 7 am till 9 pm. What is the rationale for these hours when official business should be 9 am to 5 pm?

Then I'm required to walk to the on-campus building, wait in line forever, and pay it within 2 weeks. There is very little empathy for student time.

Currently, we must go through our department to request spaces in this lot and my department has a rule where only faculty are allowed to park in this lot. I would urge that Parking Services take back the ability to assign spaces in this lot (for at least some spaces if it is not possible to do so for all) in cases where it is solely controlled by the department and reassign spaces in this lot in a more equitable manner, or at the very least use a lottery system so that everyone has an EQUAL opportunity to have access to this lot. In addition, many times, I have encountered situations where I needed to park for 20-60 minutes to \"run into\" the building and there was no short-term parking available near the Health Sciences complex. At the very least, it would be much appreciated if you could add a dozen or so spaces where staff may be able to park short term (<60 mins) when they need to access the building briefly.

      "I am an employee of UW headquartered at Harborview. I pay a biweekly fee for motorcycle parking there. I visit  the UWMC campus up to twice weekly and ride a motorcycle. Though I pay a monthly rate for motorcycle parking, this isn't recognized at UWMC, and I am expected to pay the typical parking rate for motorcycle parking that the public pays, even though I am there as a UW employee, and I have already paid for parking at my place of employment.  A person can't be in 2 places at once, yet at UWMC, one is expected to pay for motorcycle parking in 2 places at the same time. Also, the parking fee for motorcycles is greater than that for cars, as there is no hourly motorcycle parking fee.  Most motorcycles get gas mileage in excess of most hybrid vehicles, take up less space in parking, and use less non-renewable resources in their operation and construction. It is unfortunate for UW Parking to disincentivize a more efficient and environmentally friendly method of transportation. So, I end up parking on the street on Boat Street because it is cheaper than UW parking.  I am aware that there is a shuttle from Harborview, but I am not traveling to UWMC from Harborview, I am coming from dialysis units in the Central District and Lake City that are not served by public transportation that would get me there and back in less than 1.5 hours so that is not a practical option either. I  do appreciate Orca card access as part of the motorcycle parking fee as I only motorcycle 2 days/week\n",

UW should simply make scooter and motorcycle parking free. Doing so would incentivize against driving cars, and there would still be leftover space in the motorcycle lots.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on how this organization operates it seems to me that it is not designed for the benefit of the people of UW; it simply operates to squeeze as much profit as possible out of every single member of the community.

I was told that I could either buy a monthly pass at a garage multiple blocks from Harborview, or pay a daily rate for parking at View Park or NJB. (The latter option is much more expensive than a monthly pass.) Parking at a garage multiple blocks away is not a safe option for me, as I frequently work shifts that end at night when it is not safe to walk alone. I requested that Parking Services staff explore ways to increase availability of monthly parking passes in View Park and NJB, but was brusquely told that this would not be an option under any circumstances.

      "As a late-stage graduate student (basically just a working scientist at this point), I often need to come into my lab for brief periods even when I'm otherwise working from home or taking the day off. Yet the parking options near Roberts Hall are abysmal, and the gatehouse workers usually decline to give me an hourly permit for Lot C12 near the building, even after I explain that I'm a graduate student who works near there. This means I usually have to park far away from my building and walk (often in the rain, sometimes carrying large items!) across campus. And I shouldn't have to tell you that buying a quarterly parking pass is out of the question on a graduate student budget. \\r\\n\\r\\nLook, I understand that you don't want students crowding out staff/faculty who have permits for these lots with limited space, but I AM ALSO WORKING FOR THE UNIVERSITY. There needs to be some exception for the \"no hourly permits before 4pm\" rule for student employees, etc. I'm tired of having to choose between walking a quarter-mile both ways, in bad weather, within 1-2 hours, or risking a parking ticket.

I would go so far as to call them car hostile when again, some of us have no choice.   Even basic management of their parking locations is problematic, for example each year faculty must renew their parking permits and faculty/staff receive their new permits in mid June, with new permits being required in July.   Yet because this is summer break it is easy to forget the new permit when the switch happens that first week in July.   Every single year I see dozens of people ticketed in the parking garage for having their old permits rather than the new.   Why parking services doesn't put up a sign at the entrance of their facilities like the central garage reminding everyone I honestly don't know.  My guess is that they want the added revenue from all the tickets and are more interested in that than treating their customers well.   It is this anti-customer, charge more, ticket more, make it harder to park attitude that makes parking services one of the worst units on campus to deal with.  Yes they have a hard job, but they sure could be more customer friendly!\n",

Currently if I want to park at E18 for example (nice and cheap $6 per day parking), I need to drive all the way up to the parking booth by Padelford to pay, then back to the lot which can take up to 5 minutes total for that whole trip. If there was a kiosk in the lot that would be better. In addition I think the permit pricing doesn't make much sense. It's so high that it's basically the same price as is someone paid for full-day parking every day of the month. What's the point of that? It totally eliminates the incentive to purchase a permit.\n",

The policy regarding out of area for spaces near Paccar Hall has no flexiblity, which can be a real pain when we have things to bring into or out of the building.   The front gatehouse staff were pretty nasty regarding my request for out of area when I had a bunch of items to bring into Paccar.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe elevators in the Central parking garage were out of order off and on for a long period of time earlier this year.   The spaces for \"compact cars only\" on P5 are ineffective - hard to park into them and often times larger cars are parked in them, making adjacent spaces unusable.

The parking should be sold only to students, faculty, and staff, rather than being offered to the public at large (inconveniencing students). The price is also outrageous. There is no way that I could afford the parking pass on a quarterly basis which would allow me to park every day without buying a daily pass. The parking staff are often rude (especially the 50-60 year old woman with reddish hair).
